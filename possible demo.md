## Observables:

"msg"

subscribe (o) -> 

Hot & Cold Observables


* hot: 
    always running ... sweaty ... 


* cold: 
    passive ... sedentary ... begin producing notifications on request (when subscribed to)









































### Hot observables:

"ungh" <sultry voice>

Sequences that are active.

- mouse movements
- sockets


>   "Hot Observables they are always running and they broadcast notifications irrespective of who's listening... ungh"
>                                          - Leonard Knowsaboutit Nemoy




(cue the guy screaming in the field, with nobody listening)






















### Cold Observables:

Sequences that you have to ask for... 

Sequences that are passive and start producing notifications on request (when subscribed to)
    ("if only you would have asked, i would have told you")


    - async (remind me to show you an example of this)
    - Observable.Create
    - "on demand sequences"

var a = observable.subscribe(function(){
    retrn // change the view
})


== > a = observer 










### Subjects

Hot:

hot observables broadcast notifications to all observers.  The canonical example is converting an event into an observable; e.g., FromEventPattern.  If three observers subscribe to IObservable<MouseMoveEventArgs>, then each observer will serially2 observe the same notifications, as opposed to observing different notifications or concurrent notifications.
